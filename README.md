This is essentially a compositional pattern-producing network (CPPN) except it makes abstract patterns instead of meaningful shapes. Inputs: pixel coordinates, mouse/touch coordinates, cos(time). Output: RGB values. Activations: sin, cos, tanh, linear. Weights: random.

## Requirements

TensorFlow.js utilizes WebGL to make calculations faster. It can also use CPU only, but you'll get much better framerates on a GPU-equipped device.  

## Acknowledgements

The following two resources introduced me to abstract art generation with CPPNs.

I "borrowed" the idea of using cos(time) to generate dynamic patterns, but implemented the CPPN in js from scratch on my own. The idea to use mouse/touch coordinates as additional inputs came from my friend, Igor Guzman. It was my idea to add selection of activation functions and amplitude sliders for additional interactivity.
